Main library which stores all the components used on the PCBs 








# Supplier part numbers
When ordering parts, suppliers have multiple part numbers for the same part. The different part numbers correspond to how the component is supplied. It is important to choose the correct supply method as it'll make ordering all the parts significantly quicker.

## Digikey supply options
There are 3 main ways digikey supplies ICs. The 3 options are Tape and Reel (TR), Cut Tape (CT), and Digi-Reel®.

### Tape and Reel (TR)
Tape and reel is when the component is supplied in a reel protected by tape. This option generally has a minimum of 1000 to 4000 parts and are only purchased for factories that require a large quantity. Do not order parts as tape and reel.

### Cut Tape (CT)
Cute tape is essentially an entire reel that has been cut to length depending on how many parts required. This is the supply option that should be used.

### Digi-Reel®
The digi reel is similar to a tape and reel except instead of having a fixed number of parts e.g. 1000 or 4000 parts it has a specified number of parts. The digi-reel has a $10 fee ontop of the parts so don't buy as we don't need a reel anyway.
